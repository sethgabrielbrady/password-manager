A simple password manager written in javascript using node and node-persist.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. run ``npm install``
3. run ``npm start`` in the terminal.

``node-persist`` will make a folder in the root called ``persist``. In it you will
see a ``json`` file called 'accounts'.  This is the file that stores all the accounts
data created.
